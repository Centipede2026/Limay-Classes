To represent a graph we need to store 2 sets the first set represents the vertices of the graph and the second set
represents the edges. The 2 most common structures used to store these sets are Arrays and linked list. The arrays
offers some simplicity and processing efficiency, number of vertices must be known in advance, this is a major 
limitation

1.Adjacent C matrix 
The adjacent C matrix uses a vector (1-D array) for the vertices and a matrix (2-D array) to store the edges. If 2
vertices are adjacent, i.e. is there is an edge between them, then the matrix intersect has a value of 1. If there
is no edge between them the intersect is set to zero

The adjacency list uses a 2-D ragged array to store the edges.The vertex list in a singlly linked list of vertices
in a list. Depending on the application it could also be implemented using double linked list. The pointer at the 
left of the list links the vertex entries together. The pointr at the right in the vertex is a head pointer to a 
linked list of edges from the vertex.
